================

This modified version of Source Han Sans should only be used for OS X &amp; iOS's GUI font purposes.<br>
**Other purposes may conflict to SHS's Apache 2.0 License.** Just as Kobayashi Ken said:<br>
https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-sans/issues/76#issuecomment-62048522
> BTW, the Apache 2.0 license states that you cannot use trademarked names in derivative works. The "Source" name is trademarked, so in addition to adding "UI' to the names, you should also change "Source" to something else. I know that this is mainly for experimentation purposes, and what you have done does not bother me, but I simply wanted to make you aware of the terms of the license.<br>

These fonts, if installed via sudo privileges to the system font folder, are user-unaccessable hidden fonts. You may want to install official SHS build again for other usages.
