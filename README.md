================

1. This modified set of Source Han Sans is made for OS X &amp; iOS's GUI font purposes only.<br>
2. These fonts, which should be installed via sudo privileges to the system font folder, are user-unaccessable hidden fonts in every font menu in every app. You may want to install official SHS build again for other usages:<br>
